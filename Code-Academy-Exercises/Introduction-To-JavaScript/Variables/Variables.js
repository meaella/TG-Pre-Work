I leaned that a variable is a container for a value,
variables also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name.
There are only a few things I can do with variables:
1.Create a variable with a descriptive name.
2.Store or update information stored in a variable.
3.Reference or “get” information stored in a variable.
